## Introduction

Real estate is one of the most lucrative investment sectors globally. However, it is often inaccessible to the average individual due to the high entry costs. Estate Ledger aims to change this by tokenizing real-world land assets. This approach allows individuals to invest in real estate at a fraction of the traditional cost, democratizing access to this lucrative sector. The project combines the strengths of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and tokenization to create a unique platform for land acquisition, development, and sales.

## Problem Statement

The traditional real estate industry is fraught with challenges such as high entry barriers, lack of transparency, and inefficiencies in land acquisition and sales processes. These challenges often deter potential investors and make it difficult for landowners to maximize their profits.

## Smart Contracts

EstateLedger will utilize a series of smart contracts to facilitate its features:

- **Land Acquisition Contract**
  - Inputs: Land details (location, size, price, etc.), Landowner details
  - Outputs: Confirmation of land acquisition
  - Mechanism: Verifies the landowner's ownership, transfers ownership to the Estate Ledger protocol, and records the transaction on the blockchain.

- **Tokenization Contract**
  - Inputs: Land details (location, size, guideline value, etc.), Tokenization method (stable coins or fractional NFTs)
  - Outputs: Tokens representing the land
  - Mechanism: [Details of the mechanism...]
- **Sales Contract**
    - Inputs: Buyer details, Number of tokens to buy, Payment
    - Outputs: Confirmation of sale, Tokens to the buyer
    - Mechanism: Verifies the buyer's payment, transfers the tokens to the buyer, and records the transaction on the blockchain.
- **Land Development Contract**
    - Inputs: Development project details (plan, budget, timeline, etc.)
    - Outputs: Confirmation of project initiation
    - Mechanism: Records the project details on the blockchain and triggers the start of the project.
- **Commercial Activities Contract**
    - Inputs: Commercial activity details (type of activity, income generated, etc.)
    - Outputs: Confirmation of commercial activity, Income to the protocol
    - Mechanism: Records the commercial activity on the blockchain and transfers the income to the protocol.
- **Profit Distribution Contract**
    - Inputs: Total profits, Number of tokens held by each token holder
    - Outputs: Profits to the token holders and the original landowner
    - Mechanism: Calculates the share of profits for each token holder and the original landowner, transfers the profits, and records the transactions on the blockchain.
- **Governance Contract**
    - Inputs: Proposals, Votes from token holders
    - Outputs: Results of the vote
    - Mechanism: Records proposals and votes on the blockchain, calculates the results of the vote, and updates the protocol accordingly.
- **Upgrade Contract**
    - Inputs: Upgrade proposal, Votes from token holders
    - Outputs: Confirmation of upgrade
    - Mechanism: Records the upgrade proposal and votes on the blockchain, calculates the results of the vote, and implements the upgrade if approved.

These smart contracts work together to ensure the secure and efficient operation of the Estate Ledger protocol. They provide a transparent and immutable record of all transactions and activities, making it easier for users to trust the protocol. 


## Future Enhancements

- **Identity Verification**: The protocol should have a mechanism for verifying the identity of users. This will be done through a decentralized identity solution that respects user privacy while ensuring that each user is unique.
- **Derivatives:**
    
    Estate Ledger will enable the development of a range of derivative contracts, including:
    
    - Real Estate Index Funds

## Running a Haskell Project using Cabal

This guide will walk you through the process of running a Haskell project using Cabal. We'll assume that you have cloned the repository containing the project source code.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository containing the Haskell project source code. You can do this by using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KonmaLabzIO/Estate-Ledger/
```


### Step 2: Initialize Cabal Configuration

Navigate to the project directory and initialize the Cabal configuration. Cabal is a build tool for Haskell projects that helps manage dependencies and build processes. Run the following command:

```bash
cabal init
```

This command will guide you through the process of creating a `.cabal` file, which contains project configurations and metadata.

### Step 3: Build the Project

Once the `.cabal` file is generated, you can build the project by executing the following command:

```bash
cabal build
```

This command will compile the project source code and create executable files.

### Step 4: Execute the Application

To execute the application, use the `cabal exec` command followed by the name of the executable you want to run. For example, if the executable is named "Estate Ledger," use the following command:

```bash
cabal exec EstateLedger
```

This command will run the compiled application and display its output.

### Step 5: Build and Execute with a Single Command

You can also use the `cabal run` command to both build and execute the application. This command simplifies the process:

```bash
cabal run
```

Running this command will build the application, reveal executable links, and then execute the application, displaying its output.

---

With these steps, you should be able to successfully clone, initialize, build, and execute a Haskell project using Cabal. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, refer to the official Cabal documentation for additional information.
